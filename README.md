# Some bubbletea terminal game

take some grid, how could this be interesting?
user is a sprite in a maze, kind of pacman like
there's always a "target" like a portal that drops you on the next level
rate limit the movement, one character movement per 100 ms to start

Let's say it's for one concurrent user
How do levels progress?


start:
select a character
user is a purple character
other characters are orange
walls, etc are white

walls are made up of #s
The target is a @
